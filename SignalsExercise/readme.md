### Solution of the second part of the Exercise (Signals)

2) Signals

    - Write a C program `mysigcatch.c` that catches the `SIGINT` signal (usually generated by the `Ctrl+C` command in the terminal). Upon catching the signal, the program should *print* "**SIGINT signal caught!**" and then terminate gracefully.

    - Modify your program, in `mysigcatchmodified.c` in order to use a *custom signal handler function*. In the custom handler, display the **signal number of `SIGINT`** and a message indicating that the signal was caught. After *catching `SIGINT` twice*, the program should ***restore the default behavior*** for `SIGINT` and terminate upon the next signal reception.

    - Check [`OS/Lab04/examples{1-5}.c`](https://github.com/arisdask/OS/tree/main/Lab04). Write in a small summary (a couple of lines): 
        - how all codes are executed, 
        - an example usage and its output and 
        - a brief explanation of the actual C code.
